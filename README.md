Hi 👋 My name is Olga
=====================

DevOps Engineer • 2x Founder • Techie
----------------------

🧐 I have been curious about technology since I was a kid. While learning about marketing, I developped a passion for Project Management. </br></br>
⚡💼 Venturing into entrepreneurship and working as a functional analyst (AMOA) for almost 2 years helped me acquire all the skills needed to build, launch and manage an IT project. </br></br>
📚 ***I've learned mostly everything I know at home on my own*** : marketing, graphism, web development, e-commerce. No dedicated teachers, just books, documentations and YT videos :). I participated in distance learning from 2016 to 2018, during which I earned a degree in Communication and Marketing.  </br></br>
🔭 My next playgrounds are located in the Devops and Cloud areas.
