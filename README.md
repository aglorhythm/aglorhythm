Hi 👋 My name is Olga
=====================

Systems Architect & Growth Engineer @PrettySecure
Building clean, scalable, automated systems for brands, founders, and small teams.
----------------------

🧩 About me

I combine business strategy, DevOps/Cloud engineering, and automation to design digital systems that make operations smoother, faster, and easier to run.
I like building frameworks, mapping systems, fixing chaos, and designing flows that feel invisible but deliver real results.
I’m a multipotentialite founder, currently running PrettySecure, an automation & growth studio helping brands launch, relaunch, and scale with clear tech and clean operations.

🛠️ What I work on

- System architecture (DevOps, Cloud, APIs, integrations)
- Business operations & client journeys
- Automation (n8n, custom flows, AI assistants, pipelines)
- Technical branding (websites, flows, booking systems, CRM)
- Data governance (RGPD basics, access management, security)
- GTM & growth workflows for early-stage founders

🚀 Some things I’ve built

- Automated assistant + booking flow for a Paris beauty brand (no more lost messages)
- Multi-tool infrastructure for e-commerce and service businesses
- End-to-end customer journeys (from acquisition → onboarding → retention)
- Back-office systems for founders overwhelmed by tools
- Internal systems for content, operations, and data tracking
- A B2B platform with online directories - check [(details)](https://github.com/aglorhythm/entreprenher-journey/blob/main/read_famous-in-vogue_journey.md))
- An Ecommerce for gashion accessories - check [(details)](https://github.com/aglorhythm/entreprenher-journey/blob/main/read_monyka_journey.md)

📚 My path

***I've learned mostly everything I know at home on my own*** : marketing, graphism, web development, e-commerce. No dedicated teachers, just books, documentations and YT videos :). I participated in distance learning from 2014 to 2018, during which I earned a degree in Communication and Marketing.  This helped me acquire all the skills needed to build, launch, automate, grow and manage an IT project. </br></br>

- Self-taught in tech, marketing, design, automation, and product.
- Studied communication & marketing bachelor degree (2014–2018) at home. Did a DevOps Bootcamp @ [La Capsule](https://www.lacapsule.academy/program/devops-full-time).
- Worked as a business analyst (AMOA, for the government) and DevOps/Cloud apprentice at HSBC.
- Now running [PrettySecure](https://prettysecure.cloud) full-time. 🔭 Interested in Architecture, automation and AI.
- I love mixing strategy, systems thinking, aesthetics, and automation.
